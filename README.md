# Learn The Part

Learn The Part is an online learning platform that is tailored towards teachers and learners. These online courses are uploaded to Learn The Part for students to consume and enhance their skills. The courses uploaded on Learn The Part will primarily be composed of video content, written articles, quizzes, and challenges.

Learn The Part has a unique feature that allows students to get access to content using a staking mechanism powered by Dev Protocol. The Dev Protocol staking functionality allows students to stake their tokens on a course, for a certain period of time, where the tokens will be locked. During the staking/locking period, dev tokens are being accrued from the staking mechanism and funding the course creator. Students don't have to wait for the locking period to get access to the course, as soon as they commit a certain amount of devs for a certain period of time, they will receive a sToken NFT, which will automatically unlock the course. Once the locking period is completed, students can go ahead and unstake their tokens or they can keep them to continue supporting their favorite instructors. Below is a preliminary diagram to help you visualize the process itself:
